# picture-in-picture-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [picture-in-picture-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/picture-in-picture-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a picture in picture demo application. In the pop up screen, you can choose the screen that you want to share. After you selected the screen press **Share**, then click **START** button. You can see the selected browser appears at the right bottom corner.   

## Key features
